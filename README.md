# I don't have a lot of time right now, but I'll start working on the repository in a few weeks. 
## Warning: Do not add articles about the politics of countries. A repository dedicated to politics will be created in the future.
### You can also create forks of this repository in different languages. For example, a fork called awesome-arguments-de can translate this repository into German. But please don't let more than one person create repositories with the same name.

It is a waste of time discussing the same things over and over again on the internet. Send them a link to this repository instead.
This repository contains a curated list of arguments and counter-arguments on controversial topics that often provoke heated discussions on the internet. The goal is to provide well-reasoned and evidence-based perspectives on these complex issues to elevate the level of debate.

Open an issue or pull request to suggest new topics to cover. The goal is to build this into a comprehensive resource for productive discussion and debate.
For each topic, the repository provides an overview of key arguments and counter-arguments, facts and evidence to support both sides, and an analysis of the nuances and complexities in the issue. The ultimate goal is to show that many controversial topics are not black-and-white and there are merits to multiple perspectives. But some opinions are also not supported by facts, so those are clarified as needed.
Let's elevate the level of online debate together! Contributions welcome.
